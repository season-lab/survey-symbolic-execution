\begin{abstract}
Many security and software testing applications require checking if certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program's authentication. One approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint satisfaction tools to derive actual instances that cause property violations, if any. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the last four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them for broad audience.

% At a minimum you need to supply the author names, year and a title.
% IMPORTANT:
% Full first names whenever they are known, surname last, followed by a period.
% In the case of two authors, 'and' is placed between them.
% In the case of three or more authors, the serial comma is used, that is, all author names
% except the last one but including the penultimate author's name are followed by a comma,
% and then 'and' is placed before the final author's name.
% If only first and middle initials are known, then each initial
% is followed by a period and they are separated by a space.
% The remaining information (journal title, volume, article number, date, etc.) is 'auto-generated'.
